"""
How does this solution ensure data immutability?
    passes back a different collection than the one passed in

Is this solution a pure function? Why or why not?
    Yes - it does not produce side effects and does not retain state

Is this solution a higher order function? Why or why not?
    NO - it does not take functions as a paramter nor does it return a function

Would it have been easier to solve this problem using a different programming style?
    No - this seems ok

Why in particular is functional programming a helpful paradigm when solving this problem?
    Because it is side effect free and because it uses a pure function the results will be consistent and predictable
